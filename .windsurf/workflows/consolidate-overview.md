### Task: Project Overview Document Assessment and Improvement

Your primary task is to act as a reviewer for the **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`**,  **`SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md`**, **`JOBS_OVERVIEW.md`**, **`README.md`**. document for our Node.js application. This is a recurring weekly task to ensure the document remains a concise, accurate, and up-to-date guide for new and existing developers. Your goal is to not only identify areas for improvement but also to actively implement the necessary changes.
There is also a SECURITY.md file, that is NOT for you to assess, it needs the security team

### Phase 1: Assessment and Feedback

First, you will conduct a thorough review of the current **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`**,  **`SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md`**, **`JOBS_OVERVIEW.md`**, **`README.md`**. Your assessment should focus on the following points:

* **Consistency and Accuracy:** Compare the document with the latest state of the codebase. Are the described functionalities, architectural patterns, and core principles still accurate? Identify and note any discrepancies.
* **Completeness:** Is there any new feature, significant change, or critical concept from the past week's development that is not yet documented? Make a note of what needs to be added.
* **Clarity and Conciseness:** Read the document from the perspective of a new developer. Is the language clear and easy to understand? Can any sections be shortened or simplified without losing crucial information? The goal is to keep the document concise and effective, ideally no more than a few pages.

**Deliverable 1: Review Summary**

Submit a brief, written summary outlining your findings. This should include:
* A list of all inaccuracies or outdated information.
* A list of missing information or new features that need to be documented.
* Specific suggestions for improving clarity and conciseness, including which sections to shorten or rewrite.

### Phase 2: Execution and Document Update

After submitting your review summary, you will proceed with the second phase of the task: updating the documents based on your findings.

* **Correct Inaccuracies:** Update all outdated information to accurately reflect the current codebase.
* **Add New Content:** Document all missing features and new concepts identified in your review. Ensure these additions are clear and follow the document's established style.
* **Refine and Condense:** Rewrite or edit sections to improve clarity and reduce length. The goal is to make the document more scannable and digestible for developers.
* **Final Review:** Before committing your changes, read through the entire **`project_overview.md`** document one last time to ensure it is cohesive, accurate, and ready for others to use.

**Deliverable 2: Updated Document**

Commit your changes to the **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`**,  **`SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md`**, **`JOBS_OVERVIEW.md`**, **`README.md`** files in a new branch. The commit message should be clear and concise, summarizing the changes made (e.g., "DOC: Update project overview with latest features and refactor for clarity").
