### Task: Codebase Deprecation and Optimization Review

Your task is to conduct a comprehensive review of the entire codebase to identify, document, and propose solutions for deprecated content, dead code, and areas for optimization. The goal is to improve the overall health, readability, and performance of the application, **ensuring it operates efficiently to minimize resource utilization and keep operational costs low.**

---

### Phase 1: Assessment and Documentation

Begin by analyzing the project's documentation to establish a baseline understanding of its intended structure and functionality. Review the following files to identify any inconsistencies with the codebase:

* **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`**
* **`SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md`**
* **`JOBS_OVERVIEW.md`**
* **`README.md`**

After reviewing the documentation, perform a detailed scan of the entire codebase. Your analysis should focus on identifying and categorizing the following:

* **Deprecated Code:** Functions, variables, or entire modules that are no longer used or have been superseded by newer implementations.
* **Dead Code:** Code that is unreachable or serves no purpose, such as functions that are never called or conditional blocks that can never be met.
* **Confusing Elements:** Unclear comments, variables with non-descriptive names, or convoluted logic that could be simplified.
* **Optimization Opportunities:** Areas where the code could be refactored to improve performance and reduce its resource footprint, such as inefficient loops, redundant database queries, or excessive memory/CPU usage that contributes to higher operational costs.

**Deliverable 1: Review Summary**

Compile a detailed list of your findings, grouped into three distinct categories:

* **No-Brainer Removals:** Code that can be safely deleted without any negative impact on the application's functionality. This includes truly dead code and comments that are misleading or completely irrelevant.
* **Minor Refactoring:** Items that require small changes to improve clarity or remove deprecated usage. This could include renaming variables, simplifying a function's logic, or updating a few lines of code to use a more modern approach.
* **Suggestions for Major Refactoring:** Significant changes that would require a more extensive effort. This includes large-scale optimizations, architectural refactoring, or substantial rewriting of modules. For each suggestion, provide a brief explanation of the potential benefits, focusing on performance, maintainability, **and cost savings** (e.g., "Refactor the image processing module to use a more efficient library, reducing memory usage by 30% and lowering server costs").

**Upon completion of this phase, you will submit the "Review Summary" for feedback and approval before proceeding with any code changes.**

### Phase 2: Execution and Refactoring

Once the review summary has been approved, you will proceed with implementing the changes you've identified.

* **Immediate Removals:** Delete all code and comments from the "No-Brainer Removals" list.
* **Implement Minor Refactoring:** Apply the suggested changes from the "Minor Refactoring" list. Ensure that all changes are tested and do not introduce new bugs.
* **Initiate Major Refactoring (if applicable):** For items in the "Suggestions for Major Refactoring" list, if they are approved for this sprint, create a new branch and begin working on the implementation.

**Deliverable 2: Updated Codebase**

Commit your changes to a new branch for review. The commit message should be clear and concise, summarizing the work done (e.g., "CHORE: Remove dead code and refactor minor issues" or "FEAT: Implement major optimization for data processing logic").
