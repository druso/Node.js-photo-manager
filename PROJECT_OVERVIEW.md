# Project Overview: Node.js Photo Manager

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Node.js Photo Manager! This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project for new developers.

The application is a web-based photo management tool designed for amateur and professional photographers. It provides a simple way to upload, organize, and view photos from shoots. The long-term vision is to evolve this into a multi-user, online platform akin to Google Photos but with a focus on the needs of photo artists.

## 2. Core Concepts

The application is built around a few key concepts:

*   **Projects**: A Project is the primary organizational unit, representing a collection of photos from a single event or shooting session. Think of it as an "album" or a specific shoot. A photo belongs to exactly one Project.

*   **Photo Ingestion**: This is the process of adding photos to the application. Users can drag-and-drop files or use an upload button. The backend handles the file storage, creates database records, and queues up post-processing tasks.

*   **List and Viewer**: These are the main UI components for interacting with photos. The "List" view shows thumbnails of photos within a project, and the "Viewer" provides a full-size view of a single selected photo.

*   **Worker Pipeline**: To ensure the UI remains responsive, time-consuming tasks like generating thumbnails and previews are handled asynchronously by a background worker pipeline. This system is designed to be extensible for future processing needs.

*   **Manifest & Database**: While photo files (originals, raws, previews) are stored on the file system, all their metadata—such as project association, tags, timestamps, and file paths—is stored in a central database. The frontend application relies on this database for fast access to photo information.

## 3. Technology Stack

The application is built with modern, production-ready technologies:

### Frontend Dependencies
*   **React**: Component-based UI framework
*   **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
*   **PostCSS**: CSS processing and optimization

### Backend Dependencies
*   **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
*   **better-sqlite3**: High-performance SQLite database driver
*   **Sharp**: High-performance image processing library
*   **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data (file uploads)
*   **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
*   **fs-extra**: Enhanced file system operations
*   **exif-parser**: EXIF metadata extraction from images
*   **archiver**: ZIP file creation for bulk downloads

### Development Tools
*   **nodemon**: Auto-restart development server on file changes
*   **Node.js v22**: JavaScript runtime (LTS version required)
*   **npm v10+**: Package manager

## 4. Architecture Overview

The application follows a classic client-server architecture.

### Frontend (`client/`)

The frontend is a modern single-page application (SPA) responsible for all user interactions.

*   **Technology**: Built with **React** and **Vite** for fast development and building (`vite.config.mjs`). Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
*   **Source Code**: The main application logic resides in `client/src/`.
*   **Entry Point**: The main HTML file is `client/index.html`.
*   **Static Assets**: Public assets like fonts or icons are stored in `client/public/`.
*   **Key Components**: 
    *   `App.jsx`: Main application component with routing and state management
    *   `components/`: Reusable UI components (PhotoGrid, PhotoViewer, etc.)
    *   `api/`: API client modules for backend communication

### Backend (`server/`)

The backend is a Node.js application that exposes a RESTful API for the client.

*   **Technology**: Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** for routing. Uses **Sharp** for image processing, **better-sqlite3** for database operations, and **Multer** for file uploads.
*   **Entry Point**: The main server file is `server.js`.
*   **API Routes (`server/routes/`)**: This directory defines all the API endpoints. Key files include:
    *   `uploads.js`: Handles file uploads with configurable file type filtering
    *   `projects.js`: Manages project creation and data retrieval
    *   `assets.js`: Serves photo assets (previews, thumbnails) with signed URLs
    *   `jobs.js`: Provides endpoints for the worker pipeline and Server-Sent Events
    *   `tags.js`: Manages photo tagging functionality
    *   `keep.js`: Handles keep/discard decisions for RAW vs JPG files
*   **Business Logic (`server/services/`)**: This directory contains the core application logic:
    *   `db.js`: SQLite database initialization with WAL mode and foreign keys
    *   `repositories/`: Data access layer (projects, photos, tags, jobs)
    *   `workerLoop.js`: Background job processor with crash recovery
    *   `workers/`: Individual worker implementations (derivatives generation)
    *   `events.js`: Event emitter for real-time job updates
*   **Utilities (`server/utils/`)**: Contains helper functions used across the backend.

### Database

The application uses **SQLite** with better-sqlite3 for data storage, providing ACID compliance and excellent performance for this use case.

*   **Core Tables**: `projects`, `photos`, `tags`, `photo_tags` (many-to-many)
*   **Job System**: `jobs` and `job_items` tables power the async worker pipeline
*   **Features**: WAL mode enabled, foreign key constraints, comprehensive indexing
*   **Migration**: Evolved from file-based manifest.json to normalized SQLite schema
*   **Data Access**: Repository pattern with dedicated modules in `server/services/repositories/`

Refer to `SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed table structures, relationships, and migration information.

Refer to `SECURITY.md` for detailed security implementation and best practices.

## 6. Key Workflows

### Photo Ingestion Flow

1.  **Upload**: The user uploads one or more image files via the client UI.
2.  **API Request**: The client sends the files to the `/api/uploads` endpoint on the server.
3.  **File Storage**: The server saves the original files to a designated storage location defined in the configuration.
4.  **Database Entry**: The server creates records for the new photos in the database, associating them with a project.
5.  **Job Queuing**: A new job is created and added to the `jobs` table in the database (e.g., `generate_previews`).

### Worker Pipeline Flow

1.  **Job Polling**: The `workerLoop.js` service periodically polls the `jobs` table for new, unprocessed jobs.
2.  **Job Execution**: When a new job is found, the worker executes the corresponding task (e.g., the thumbnail generation worker is called).
3.  **Processing**: The worker generates the required assets (e.g., a JPEG preview and a smaller thumbnail) and saves them to the appropriate directory.
4.  **Update Database**: The paths to the newly generated assets are saved in the photo's database record.
5.  **Job Completion**: The job is marked as `completed` in the `jobs` table.

## 7. Getting Started
