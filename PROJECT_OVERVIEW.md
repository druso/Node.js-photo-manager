# Project Overview: Node.js Photo Manager

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Node.js Photo Manager! This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project for new developers.

The application is a web-based photo management tool designed for amateur and professional photographers. It provides a simple way to upload, organize, and view photos from shoots. The long-term vision is to evolve this into a multi-user, online platform akin to Google Photos but with a focus on the needs of photo artists.

## 2. Core Concepts

The application is built around a few key concepts:

*   **Projects**: A Project is the primary organizational unit, representing a collection of photos from a single event or shooting session. Think of it as an "album" or a specific shoot. A photo belongs to exactly one Project.

*   **Photo Ingestion**: This is the process of adding photos to the application. Users can drag-and-drop files or use an upload button. The backend handles the file storage, creates database records, and queues up post-processing tasks.

*   **List and Viewer**: These are the main UI components for interacting with photos. The "List" view shows thumbnails of photos within a project, and the "Viewer" provides a full-size view of a single selected photo.

*   **Worker Pipeline**: To ensure the UI remains responsive, time-consuming tasks like generating thumbnails and previews are handled asynchronously by a background worker pipeline. This system is designed to be extensible for future processing needs.

*   **Database**: While photo files (originals, raws, previews) are stored on the file system, all their metadata—such as project association, tags, timestamps, and file paths—is stored in a central SQLite database. The frontend application relies on this database for fast access to photo information.

## 3. Technology Stack

The application is built with modern, production-ready technologies:

### Frontend Dependencies
*   **React**: Component-based UI framework
*   **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
*   **PostCSS**: CSS processing and optimization

### Backend Dependencies
*   **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
*   **better-sqlite3**: High-performance SQLite database driver
*   **Sharp**: High-performance image processing library
*   **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data (file uploads)
*   **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
*   **fs-extra**: Enhanced file system operations
*   **exif-parser**: EXIF metadata extraction from images
*   **archiver**: ZIP file creation for bulk downloads

### Development Tools
*   **nodemon**: Auto-restart development server on file changes
*   **Node.js v22**: JavaScript runtime (LTS version required)
*   **npm v10+**: Package manager

## 4. Architecture Overview

The application follows a classic client-server architecture.

### Frontend (`client/`)

The frontend is a modern single-page application (SPA) responsible for all user interactions.

*   **Technology**: Built with **React** and **Vite** for fast development and building (`vite.config.mjs`). Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
*   **Source Code**: The main application logic resides in `client/src/`.
*   **Entry Point**: The main HTML file is `client/index.html`.
*   **Static Assets**: Public assets like fonts or icons are stored in `client/public/`.
*   **Key Components**: 
    *   `App.jsx`: Main application component with routing and state management
    *   `components/`: Reusable UI components (PhotoGrid, PhotoViewer, etc.)
    *   `api/`: API client modules for backend communication

### Backend (`server/`)

The backend is a Node.js application that exposes a RESTful API for the client.

*   **Technology**: Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** for routing. Uses **Sharp** for image processing, **better-sqlite3** for database operations, and **Multer** for file uploads.
*   **Entry Point**: The main server file is `server.js`.
*   **API Routes (`server/routes/`)**: This directory defines all the API endpoints. Key files include:
    *   `uploads.js`: Handles file uploads with configurable file type filtering
    *   `projects.js`: Manages project creation and data retrieval
    *   `assets.js`: Serves photo assets (previews, thumbnails) with signed URLs
    *   `jobs.js`: Provides endpoints for the worker pipeline and Server-Sent Events
    *   `tags.js`: Manages photo tagging functionality
    *   `keep.js`: Handles keep/discard decisions for RAW vs JPG files
*   **Business Logic (`server/services/`)**: This directory contains the core application logic:
    *   `db.js`: SQLite database initialization with WAL mode and foreign keys
    *   `repositories/`: Data access layer (projects, photos, tags, jobs)
    *   **Worker Loop**: Background job processor with crash recovery and configuration sanity warnings (e.g., zero normal-lane slots)
    *   `workers/`: Individual worker implementations (derivatives generation)
    *   `events.js`: Event emitter for real-time job updates
*   **Utilities (`server/utils/`)**: Contains helper functions used across the backend.

#### Project Folders (Fresh Start)

Projects are stored on disk under `<repoRoot>/.projects/<project_folder>/` where `project_folder` is always of the form `<slug(project_name)>--p<id>`. Duplicate human names are allowed; uniqueness is enforced by `project_folder`.

On creation, the server ensures these subdirectories exist:
- `.thumb` for thumbnails
- `.preview` for previews
- `.trash` for temporary removals

### Database

The application uses **SQLite** with better-sqlite3 for data storage, providing ACID compliance and excellent performance for this use case.

*   **Core Tables**: `projects`, `photos`, `tags`, `photo_tags` (many-to-many)
*   **Job System**: `jobs` and `job_items` tables power the async worker pipeline
*   **Features**: WAL mode enabled, foreign key constraints, comprehensive indexing
*   **Storage**: Uses SQLite with WAL mode for ACID compliance and performance
*   **Data Access**: Repository pattern with dedicated modules in `server/services/repositories/`

Refer to `SCHEMA_DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed table structures and relationships.

## 5. Key Features

### Photo Management
*   **Multi-format Support**: Handles JPG, PNG, TIFF, and various RAW formats (CR2, NEF, ARW, DNG)
*   **Project Organization**: Photos are organized into projects (albums/shoots)
*   **Metadata Extraction**: Automatic EXIF data parsing for timestamps, camera settings, etc.
*   **Keep/Discard System**: Deterministic handling of RAW+JPG pairs. By default, `keep_jpg` and `keep_raw` mirror actual file availability and are automatically realigned during uploads and post‑processing. Users can change intent and later Commit or Revert.

### Image Processing
*   **Automatic Thumbnails**: Generated asynchronously for fast grid viewing
*   **Preview Generation**: High-quality previews for detailed viewing
*   **Configurable Quality**: Thumbnail and preview settings in configuration
*   **Orientation Handling**: Proper rotation based on EXIF orientation data

### User Interface
*   **Drag & Drop Upload**: Intuitive file upload with progress tracking
*   **Grid and Table Views**: Multiple viewing modes for photo browsing
*   **Full-screen Viewer**: Detailed photo viewing with zoom and navigation
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive keyboard navigation (see configuration)
 *   **Real-time Updates**: Live job progress via Server-Sent Events
 *   **Incremental Thumbnails (SSE)**: Pending thumbnails update via item-level SSE events; no client-side probing of asset URLs
*   **Optimistic Updates**: Keep/Tag/Revert actions update the UI immediately without a full data refetch, preserving browsing context.
*   **Scroll Preservation**: Grid/table and viewer preserve scroll position and context during incremental updates. Selection is maintained unless an action explicitly clears it.
*   **Layout Stability**: Thumbnail cells use constant border thickness; selection changes only color/ring, avoiding micro layout shifts that can nudge scroll.
 *   **Grid Lazy-Load Reset Policy**: The grid’s visible window only resets when changing projects (or lazy threshold), not on incremental data updates.
 *   **Scroll/Viewer Preservation**: Window/main scroll and open viewer are preserved across background refreshes and fallback refetches.

### Tagging System
*   **Flexible Tagging**: Add custom tags to photos for organization
*   **Tag Management**: Create, edit, and delete tags
*   **Many-to-many Relationships**: Photos can have multiple tags

### Background Processing
*   **Async Job Pipeline**: Non-blocking image processing
*   **Job Status Tracking**: Real-time progress monitoring
*   **Crash Recovery**: Automatic restart of failed jobs
*   **Extensible Workers**: Easy to add new processing tasks

### Security
*   **Signed URLs**: Secure access to photo assets with expiration
*   **File Type Validation**: Server-side filtering of uploaded files
*   **CORS Protection**: Configurable cross-origin access controls

Refer to `SECURITY.md` for detailed security implementation and best practices.

## 6. Key Workflows

### Photo Ingestion Flow

1.  **Upload**: The user uploads one or more image files via the client UI.
2.  **API Request**: The client sends the files to the `/api/uploads` endpoint on the server.
3.  **File Storage**: The server saves the original files to a designated storage location defined in the configuration.
4.  **Database Entry**: The server creates records for the new photos in the database, associating them with a project.
5.  **Job Queuing**: A new job is created and added to the `jobs` table in the database (e.g., `generate_previews`).

### Worker Pipeline Flow

1.  **Job Polling**: The `workerLoop.js` service periodically polls the `jobs` table for new, unprocessed jobs.
2.  **Job Execution**: When a new job is found, the worker executes the corresponding task (e.g., the thumbnail generation worker is called).
3.  **Processing**: The worker generates the required assets (e.g., a JPEG preview and a smaller thumbnail) and saves them to the appropriate directory.
4.  **Update Database**: The paths to the newly generated assets are saved in the photo's database record.
5.  **Job Completion**: The job is marked as `completed` in the `jobs` table.

### Maintenance Processes

Maintenance tasks keep the on‑disk state and the database in sync. They are implemented as high‑priority, idempotent jobs handled by the same worker loop.

Job types:

- `trash_maintenance`: Remove files in `.trash` older than 24h.
- `manifest_check`: Verify DB availability flags (`jpg_available`, `raw_available`) against files on disk and fix discrepancies.
- `folder_check`: Scan the project folder for untracked files; enqueue `upload_postprocess` for accepted files; move unaccepted files to `.trash`.
- `manifest_cleaning`: Delete rows where both JPG and RAW are unavailable.

Scheduler (`server/services/scheduler.js`) cadence:

- Hourly: `trash_maintenance` (priority 100)
- Every 6h: `manifest_check` (95)
- Every 6h (staggered by 30m): `folder_check` (95)
- Daily: `manifest_cleaning` (80)

Manual reconciliation endpoints:

- `POST /api/projects/:folder/commit-changes`
  - Moves non‑kept files to `.trash` based on `keep_jpg`/`keep_raw` flags
  - Deletes generated derivatives for JPGs moved to `.trash` (removes `.thumb/<base>.jpg` and `.preview/<base>.jpg` immediately)
  - Updates DB availability flags accordingly
  - Enqueues `manifest_check`, `folder_check`, and `manifest_cleaning`
  - See implementation in `server/routes/maintenance.js`
- `POST /api/projects/:folder/revert-changes`
  - Non‑destructive. Resets `keep_jpg := jpg_available` and `keep_raw := raw_available` for all photos in the project.
  - Clears any pending destructive actions without moving files.
  - See implementation in `server/routes/maintenance.js`

Client behavior after reconciliation endpoints:

- After a successful `POST /revert-changes`, the client optimistically updates in-memory photo state to set `keep_jpg`/`keep_raw` from availability, avoiding a full refetch and preserving scroll/selection.
- After a successful `POST /commit-changes`, the UI avoids hard reloads; asset changes propagate via background jobs/SSE and normal data refreshes, minimizing disruptive updates.

## 7. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js v22 LTS** (required - check with `node --version`)
*   **npm v10+** (check with `npm --version`)
*   **Git** (for cloning and version control)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone and Navigate**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Node.js-photo-manager
    ```

## 12. UI Animations

Centralized CSS animations live in `client/src/styles/animations.css` and are imported globally from `client/src/index.css`.

Available utility classes:

- `animate-fadeInScale`: Small popovers/menus fade + scale in (150ms).
- `animate-slideDownFade`: Dropdowns slide down + fade (140ms).
- `animate-slideInRightFade`: Right drawers slide-in + fade (180ms).
- `animate-fadeIn`: Simple fade-in (e.g., backdrops) (160ms).

Usage:

- Add the class to the element that mounts when shown. Examples:
  - `client/src/components/OperationsMenu.jsx` uses `animate-slideDownFade` on the dropdown panel.
  - `client/src/components/SettingsProcessesModal.jsx` uses `animate-slideInRightFade` on the drawer and `animate-fadeIn` on the backdrop.
  - `client/src/App.jsx` uses `animate-fadeInScale` when swapping toolbar controls with the Actions menu.

Adding new animations:

- Define keyframes and a class in `client/src/styles/animations.css`, then apply the class where needed.

### 12.1 Global Toast Notifications

A centralized toast system provides consistent, reusable notifications across the frontend.

- Location:
  - Provider/Hook: `client/src/ui/toast/ToastContext.jsx`
  - Container: `client/src/ui/toast/ToastContainer.jsx`
  - Presets: `client/src/ui/toast/toastPresets.js`
- Wiring:
  - `client/src/main.jsx` wraps `<App />` with `<ToastProvider>`
- Variants: `notification` (default), `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`
- Defaults: auto‑dismiss (2s info/success/notification, 4s warning, 6s error), max stack 3
- UX: pause on hover, manual close button, accessible roles (`status`/`alert`)
- Animations: slide-in from side on enter; slide-up + fade on exit

Usage from any component:

```jsx
import { useToast } from '../ui/toast/ToastContext';

function ExampleButton() {
  const toast = useToast();
  return (
    <button onClick={() => toast.show({ emoji: '✅', message: 'Saved', variant: 'success' })}>
      Save
    </button>
  );
}
```

Toast patterns (recommended):

- Use `variant: 'success'` for completed actions that change state; keep short (≈2s) and include an emoji ✅.
- Use `variant: 'error'` for failures; longer duration (≈6s) and include ⚠️. Provide a next step if possible.
- Use `variant: 'info'` for transient status messages (e.g., queued) or `notification` for neutral updates.
- Prefer `toast.promise()` for async flows so the pending/success/error states are consistent.
- Keep messages concise; the first word should be the action/result (e.g., "Uploaded", "Deleted", "Failed").
- Register offsets for any fixed-position bars/toolbars to avoid overlap.
- Accessibility: animated toasts use `status` (non-interruptive) by default; critical failures can use `alert`.

Promise helper:

```jsx
const toast = useToast();
await toast.promise(
  apiCall(),
  {
    pending: { emoji: '⏳', message: 'Uploading…', variant: 'info' },
    success: { emoji: '✅', message: 'Upload complete', variant: 'success' },
    error:   { emoji: '⚠️', message: 'Upload failed', variant: 'error' }
  }
);
```

Position and durations can be customized via `<ToastProvider position="bottom-right" max={3} defaultDurations={{ info: 2000, success: 2000, notification: 2000, warning: 4000, error: 6000 }} />`.

Offsetting toasts to avoid overlapping UI:

- The toast system supports dynamic top/bottom offsets so bars/toolbars can reserve space.
- API: `toast.setOffset(name, pxOrObject)` and `toast.clearOffset(name)`.
  - `pxOrObject` can be a number (interpreted as bottom offset) or `{ top?: number, bottom?: number }`.

Example: bottom upload bar reserves space automatically (implemented in `BottomUploadBar.jsx`). For custom components like a top toolbar:

```jsx
import { useLayoutEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useToast } from '../ui/toast/ToastContext';

function TopToolbar() {
  const toast = useToast();
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (!ref.current) return;
    const el = ref.current;
    const measure = () => toast.setOffset('top-toolbar', { top: Math.ceil(el.getBoundingClientRect().height) });
    measure();
    const ro = new ResizeObserver(measure); ro.observe(el);
    window.addEventListener('resize', measure);
    return () => { ro.disconnect(); window.removeEventListener('resize', measure); toast.clearOffset('top-toolbar'); };
  }, [toast]);
  return <div ref={ref}>/* toolbar */</div>;
}
```

Additionally, the commit/revert bottom bar registers a bottom offset so toasts never cover it and do not affect page scroll.

### 12.2 Incremental Thumbnail Availability

The grid shows thumbnails as soon as they become available while a batch job is still running.

- Implementation: Item-level Server-Sent Events (`GET /api/jobs/stream`) emit updates of the form `{ type: 'item', project_folder, filename, thumbnail_status, preview_status, updated_at }` from `derivativesWorker` as each file completes.
- UI handling: `client/src/App.jsx` patches the affected photo in-place within `projectData.photos` to avoid full-grid re-renders and preserve scroll/selection.
- Asset caching: The final `<img>` for thumbnails appends `?v=<photo.updated_at>` to break negative caches once generated.
- No probing: `Thumbnail.jsx` no longer probes asset URLs while pending, reducing 404s and network noise.

Fallback behavior: If SSE is not yet connected, the client performs light polling (every ~3s) while any items are pending; scroll and open viewer state are preserved across these refetches.

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Configuration Setup**:
    ```bash
    cp config.default.json config.json
    ```
    Edit `config.json` to customize:
    - File storage paths
    - Database location (auto-created)
    - Upload file type restrictions
    - Processing settings

5.  **Database Initialization**:
    The SQLite database is automatically created on first run. No manual migration needed.

6.  **Start Development Servers**:
    
    **Terminal 1 - Backend**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # Auto-restart on changes
    # or npm start for production mode
    ```
    Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`
    
    **Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```
    Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

7.  **Verify Setup**:
    - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
    - Create a new project
    - Upload a test image
    - Check that thumbnails generate automatically

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build  # Builds client to client/dist/
```

## 8. Configuration

The application's behavior is controlled by the `config.json` file (not in source control).

### Key Configuration Sections

#### File Upload Settings
```json
"uploader": {
  "accepted_files": {
    "extensions": ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "tif", "tiff", "raw", "cr2", "nef", "arw", "dng"],
    "mime_prefixes": ["image/"]
  }
}
```

#### Image Processing
```json
"processing": {
  "thumbnail": { "maxDim": 200, "quality": 80 },
  "preview": { "maxDim": 6000, "quality": 80 }
}
```

#### Worker Pipeline
```json
"pipeline": {
  "max_parallel_jobs": 1,
  "max_parallel_items_per_job": 1,
  "heartbeat_ms": 1000,
  "stale_seconds": 60,
  "max_attempts_default": 3,
  "priority_lane_slots": 1,
  "priority_threshold": 90
}
```

- The worker loop runs two lanes: a priority lane (jobs with `priority >= priority_threshold`) and a normal lane. Priority lane has its own slots (`priority_lane_slots`) so lightweight maintenance jobs are not blocked by long-running normal jobs.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
```json
"keyboard_shortcuts": {
  "next_photo": "ArrowRight",
  "prev_photo": "ArrowLeft",
  "zoom_in": "=",
  "zoom_out": "-",
  "view_grid": "g",
  "view_table": "t",
  "toggle_filters": "f",
  "keep_jpg_only": "j",
  "keep_raw_and_jpg": "r"
}
```

#### UI Preferences
```json
"ui": {
  "default_view_mode": "grid",
  "filters_collapsed_default": true,
  "remember_last_project": true
}
```

See `config.default.json` for the complete configuration template with all available options.

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot find module" errors
*   **Solution**: Run `npm install` in both root and `client/` directories
*   **Check**: Node.js version compatibility (v22 required)

#### Upload failures
*   **Check**: File type restrictions in `config.json`
*   **Check**: Disk space and write permissions
*   **Check**: File size limits (default: no limit, but check system)

#### Thumbnails not generating
*   **Check**: Worker loop is running (should see console output)
*   **Check**: Sharp library installation (native dependencies)
*   **Check**: Source image file accessibility

#### Database errors
*   **Check**: Write permissions for database directory
*   **Check**: SQLite file not corrupted (backup and recreate if needed)
