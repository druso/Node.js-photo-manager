Milestone 1: The Foundation - Admin Authentication & Authorization
Goal: Lock down the entire application behind a single password. No public access yet.
Result of Milestone 1: The entire application is functional but only for a user who has logged in as an Admin. The foundation for role-based access is now in place.
