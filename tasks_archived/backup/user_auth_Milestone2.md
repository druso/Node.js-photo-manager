Milestone 2: The Public/Private Image System
Goal: Introduce the concept of image visibility and allow direct access to public images.
Result of Milestone 2: Admins can manage the public/private status of photos. A public user can now view a public photo if they have the direct URL to it, but they cannot browse any galleries.
